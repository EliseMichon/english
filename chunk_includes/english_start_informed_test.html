Before going on, we would like to inform you that at the beginning of the experiment, you were familiarized with syllables with a common characteristic.
<br><br>
This characteristic is randomly chosen for each participant from three possibilities. From your point of view, in the syllables you heard with the images, 
<br><br>
<b>(A) the <font color="red">vowels</font> were associated to the <font color="blue">first consonant</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always after <font color="blue">"m"</font> and <font color="red">"e"</font> always after <font color="blue">"n"</font> (like in "mar" and "neb").</i><br>
<b>OR<br>
(B) the <font color="red">vowels</font> were associated to the <font color="green">speaker</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always pronounced by <font color="green">Mr Smith</font> and <font color="red">"e"</font> always pronounced by <font color="green">Mr Jones</font>.</i><br>
<b>OR<br>
(C) the <font color="red">vowels</font> were associated to the <font color="purple">intonation</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always pronounced with a <font color="purple">falling intonation</font> (like in « Dot. ») and <br>
<font color="red">"e"</font> always pronounced with a <font color="purple">rising intonation</font> (like in « What ?»).</i>
<br><br>
Note that the <font color="red">vowels </font> were associated to <u>only one</u> property of the syllables <br>
(<font color="blue">consonant (A)</font>, <font color="green">speaker (B)</font> OR <font color="purple">intonation (C)</font>). 
<br><br>
Now that you have more information on what you heard earlier, you are going to listen to pairs of syllables again and you will be asked to determine which one sounds the most familiar.
<br><br>
For each pair, only one of the two syllables has the characteristic you have heard many examples of (A, B or C).<br>
But again, please do not think too much and try to base your answer on your intuition!
