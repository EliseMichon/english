Before going on, we would like to inform you that the syllables you have heard with the images, at the beginning of the experiment, all had a common characteristic.
<br><br>
This characteristic is randomly chosen for each participant from three possibilities:
<br><br>
<b>(A) the <font color="red">vowels</font> are associated to the <font color="blue">first consonant</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always after <font color="blue">"m"</font> and <font color="red">"e"</font> always after <font color="blue">"n"</font> (like in "mar" and "neb").</i><br>
<b>OR<br>
(B) the <font color="red">vowels</font> are associated to the <font color="green">speaker</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always pronounced by <font color="green">Mr Smith</font> and <font color="red">"e"</font> always pronounced by <font color="green">Mr Jones</font>.</i><br>
<b>OR<br>
(C) the <font color="red">vowels</font> are associated to the <font color="purple">intonation</font> of the syllables ?</b><br>
<i>For example : <br>
<font color="red">"a"</font> always pronounced with a <font color="purple">falling intonation</font> (like in « Dot. ») and <br>
<font color="red">"e"</font> always pronounced with a <font color="purple">rising intonation</font> (like in « What ?»).</i>
<br><br>
Note that in the syllables that you have heard with the images, <br>
the <font color="red">vowels </font> were associated to <u>only one</u> other property of the syllables <br>
(<font color="blue">consonant</font>, <font color="green">speaker</font> OR <font color="purple">intonation</font>). 
<br><br>
You are now going to listen to pairs of syllables again. 
<br><br>
Given that only one of the two syllables has the characteristic you have heard many examples of (A, B or C), for each pair, we ask you to determine which one sounds the most familiar.
<br><br>
Again, please do not think too much and try to base your answer on your intuition!
<br><br>
